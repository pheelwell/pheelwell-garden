then details 

The inverted pyramid is a writing technique that journalists use to present the most important information first. The idea is to start with the most newsworthy facts, such as who, what, when, where, why and how, and then provide additional details in order of decreasing importance. This way, the reader can quickly grasp the main point of the story and decide whether to continue reading or not. The inverted pyramid also helps editors to cut the story from the bottom if there is not enough space in the publication.
