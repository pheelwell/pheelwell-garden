## Period of Zygote / Germinal (0-3 weeks)
begins at conception; 
unity of two gametes, [[Fertilisation]] 
sperm and egg cell form a **zygote**
zygote multiplies and travels from fallopian tube to uterine wall
zygote -> **blastocyst**
### Blastocyst 
has three layers 

1. **endoderm**
inner layer
digestive and respiratory

2. **mesoderm**
middle layer
muscle and skeletal

3. **ectoderm**
outer layer
nervous system and skin

##  
**implantation** takes place

## Period of Embryo / Embryonic (3 weeks - 9 weeks)
after implantation
cells now form an embryo 
development of brain; structure of forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain
heart begins to develop and pulse
arms and legs start to form 

## Period of Fetus/ Fetal (9th week till birth)
sex determined around 9 weeks 
fetus will be able to move limbs 
nails, lashes, hair grow 
most growth weight and length wise happens during this period

# **life support systems**
1. amnion
2. umblical corc
3. placenta

## Amnion 
bag/sac like 
contains amniotic fluid where embryo floats
**homeostasis** -> temp, humidity
**shockproof**

## Umblical cord
**2 arteries and 1 vein**
connects placenta and baby

## Placenta 
Support system for baby
disc shaped 
supplies necessary nutrients and other material needed 
takes away toxic waste from the processes (digestive)


# Trimesters
3 trimesters - 9 months
each trimester = 3 months

First trimester 
becomes a fetus;
major organ systems develop
morning sickness, fatigue

Second trimester 
feel movement as the fetus flips and turns
can hear, see, 

third trimester 

# Teratogens
etymology - Greek word teratos = monster 

substances that interfere with normal fetal development and cause disabilities

Drugs (both prescription, non-prescription and recreational)

Incompatible Blood types (Rhesus factor)
	blood can be rh positive or rh negative 

Environmental Hazards 
	radiation
	toxic waste
	pesticide

Maternal illnesses
	rubella, syphilis, AIDS, herpes, diabetes

Maternal Diet 

Stress 

Age

Damaged sperms
