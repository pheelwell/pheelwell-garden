The Dunning–Kruger effect is a theoretical **cognitive bias** which was described by **David Dunning** and **Justin Kruger** in a 1999 psychological study and paper. 

The study suggests that people with a low level of ability at a task are likely to overestimate their ability of the task. The proposed reason for this bias is that **sufficient _awareness_** of the complexity of a problem or domain is required for a person to be able to make an informed opinion of their capability to work in that domain.

A form of ***illusory superiority***
