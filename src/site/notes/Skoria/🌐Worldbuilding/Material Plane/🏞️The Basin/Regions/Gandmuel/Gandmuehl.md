The sun sets over the small town of Gandmühl, casting a warm glow on the elven faces that bustle through the streets. The scent of freshly baked bread fills the air, drawing travelers from far and wide to taste its legendary flavor. But beneath this idyllic surface, tensions simmer between those who wish to preserve the town's heritage and those who seek progress through tourism.

## Overview
Gandmühl is a quaint town of approximately 2000 residents, predominantly elves. Traditionally a lumber trading community, Gandmühl has recently gained fame for its delicious bread produced by a local bakery. This newfound attention has divided the town into two factions: The Chuckers who wish to continue their focus on lumber trading, and The Reformers who yearn to expand tourism. Governed by an elven council, the once peaceful town now teeters at the brink of political turmoil as these factions vie for dominance.

Nestled beside a river and surrounded by forest and fields, Gandmühl's landscape offers an idyllic backdrop for both work and leisure. The Chuckers reside on the eastern side of town near their lumber mills, while The Reformers inhabit the western side close to the harbor that brings in tourists.
