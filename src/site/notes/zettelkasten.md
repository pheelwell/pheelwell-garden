## Quick Facts
- *Zettelkasten Method* is a method of note-taking and organization. It is German for *"slip box"*. 
- Popularized by Niklas Luhmann[^1]. 
- Great for building a [[second brain]] 
- Can help find connections between notes
- Useful for thinking more broadly by not confining your notes to a subject 
---

So basically, the Zettelkasten Method relies on interconnectivity of information, and atomicity of concepts. You make notes that work independently. If you feel a connection, you note it down.

## Luhmann's Zettelkasten - The Method in His Words
Luhmann used a physical box of cards. Made 90,000+ handwritten notes. 

Some of Luhmann's comments on the method (emboldening by me) - 

 “Underlying the filing technique is the experience that **without writing, there is no thinking.**”
 
 **“I always read with an eye towards possible connections in the slip-box.”** [2]
 
 “I, of course, do not think everything by myself. It happens mainly within the slip-box.”
 
 (The zettelkasten is a) “combination of disorder and order, of clustering and unpredictable combinations emerging from ad hoc selection.”

>"Probably the **best method is to take notes – not excerpts, but condensed reformulated accounts of a text**. Rewriting what was already written almost automatically trains one to shift the attention towards frames, patterns and categories in the observations, or the conditions/assumptions, which enable certain, but not other descriptions.”*

## Principles of Zettelkasten

1. Note taking - Take notes. Not excerpts, but how you understand it. In your own words. 
2. Atomicity - *He realised that **one idea, one note was only as valuable as its context**, which was not necessarily the context it was taken from*. So, one idea per note.
3. Autonomy - Notes should make sense by themselves too. 
4. Connect Notes - Try to link all notes. *"A note that is not connected to the network will be lost, will be forgotten by the Zettelkasten"*
5. Number your notes - use any numbering system and stick to it. It's just a way to identify the cards for linking. The numbers do not mean anything. **The point of the method is not having to worry where a note goes.** 
6. 

The core of the technique lies in a few simple principles:
- Write liberally about what you think and read. Write in detail so you can quickly re-internalize ideas after you forget them.
- Wherever you can, separate notes into **small and distinct ideas**.
- When you notice connections between ideas, encode them by writing references from one note to another.
- When you want to think or write, read your notes and follow the references between them.
- Update as you go. Find something new to add? Add it. Don't agree with something you had written once? Don't trash the old note! Make a connection to the new one and explain why you changed your mind.

[^1]: - Niklas Luhmann was a sociologist and a prolific writer having published as many as 70 books and nearly 400 scholarly articles. His main work was in Systems Theory. Luhmann himself described his theory as "labyrinthine" or "non-linear" and claimed he was deliberately keeping his prose enigmatic to prevent it from being understood "too quickly", which would only produce simplistic misunderstandings!

[^2]: - Personal note - This is what helped me the most and why I find this method pretty much life-changing. It has changed the way I process things, the way I learn things. This way, I've been more [[mindfulness|mindful]] of what I'm reading, what is important. As a result, I've been able to retain more.
