[[Allen Ginsberg]] also made an intense study of haiku and the paintings of Paul Cézanne, from which he adapted a concept important to his work, which he called the **Eyeball Kick**. 

He noticed in viewing Cézanne's paintings that when the eye moved from one color to a contrasting color, the eye would spasm, or "kick." 

Likewise, he discovered that the contrast of two seeming opposites was a common feature in haiku. Ginsberg used this technique in his poetry, **putting together two starkly dissimilar images: something weak with something strong, an artifact of high culture with an artifact of low culture, something holy with something unholy.**
