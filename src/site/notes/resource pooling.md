technique that allows a service provider to serve multiple clients or tenants with scalable and adjustable services. 

service provider groups and manages similar resources, such as computation, network, storage, or services, and **allocates them to different clients according to their needs**. 

Resource pooling helps to improve the efficiency, availability, and flexibility of cloud computing by reducing wastage and optimizing costs.

In simple terms, resource pooling is like sharing a pool of resources with others in the cloud. You can use as much or as little of the resources as you want, and you don't have to worry about where they come from or how they are managed. The service provider takes care of that for you.
