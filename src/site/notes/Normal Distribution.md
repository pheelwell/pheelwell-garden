[[Normal Curve]]

describes **how data is spread out around a central value**. For example, if you measure the heights of many people, you will find that most of them are close to the average height, and only a few are much taller or shorter. A normal distribution looks like a bell-shaped curve when you plot it on a graph. The highest point of the curve is the mean (the average value), and the width of the curve shows how much the data varies from the mean. A normal distribution is useful in statistics because it can help us make predictions and comparisons based on data.
