 a mathematical formula that allows us to update our beliefs or hypotheses based on new evidence or data. 
 
 It shows how the **prior probability** of a hypothesis (what we already know or assume) and the **likelihood of the evidence** (how well the evidence supports the hypothesis) **affect the posterior probability** of the hypothesis (what we learn after seeing the evidence).
