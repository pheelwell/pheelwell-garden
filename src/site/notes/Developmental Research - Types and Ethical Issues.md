# Types of developmental research designs 

## Cross-sectional design 
A cross-sectional study compares the behaviors of **different age groups** at a **single time point**.

most common in developmental research 

less time-consuming and less expensive than the other methods 

## Longitudinal design
examine the **same** individuals over a period of time; **regular intervals**

Longitudinal research takes time. Sometimes people quit before it ends. This is called **attrition**. Researchers should start with larger samples as people will leave. But some groups may leave more than others. For example, people who are sick, poor, or less educated may quit more. This can make the results less accurate because the people who stay are not representative of the whole population. 

takes a long time 

## Sequential design
include elements of both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies 

## Ethnography 
focuses on the lived experience of people, usually as detailed by the research participants (also called “informants”) and as observed by the researcher
relies heavily on **participant observation**
