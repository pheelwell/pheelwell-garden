was a group of associated English writers, intellectuals, philosophers and artists in the first half of the 20th century

According to Ian Ousby, "although its members denied being a group in any formal sense, they were **united by an abiding belief in the importance of the arts**."

Their works and outlook deeply influenced literature, aesthetics, criticism, and economics as well as modern attitudes towards **feminism**, **pacifism**, and **sexuality**. 

A well-known quote, attributed to Dorothy Parker, is ***"they lived in squares, painted in circles and loved in triangles"***.

Members included:
[[Virginia Woolf]],
Vanessa Bell 
Leonard Woolf 
Clive Bell
Roger Fry
etc.
