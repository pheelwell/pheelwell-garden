**Key value pair**

## Hashtable 
indexable 
has 3 functions - 
	insert (key,value)
	get (key)
	delete (key)


signatures, cryptography, cybersecurity, data indexing
data indexing

checksum

## Use
Passwords are run against a cryptographic hash
to produce a digest
the hash values are stored and are compared instead of plaintext passwords
this is more secure in case of leaks
