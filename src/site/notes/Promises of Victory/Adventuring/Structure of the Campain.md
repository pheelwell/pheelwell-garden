![Pasted image 20230330011335.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020230330011335.png)
Promises of Victory is a Campain set in [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/The Basin\|The Basin]], a Region currently in war, lead by the **[[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/League of Arathor/League of Arathor\|League of Arathor]]** and the **[[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Defilers/Defilers\|Defilers]]**.

In the Background [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/The Shaddowhammer\|The Shaddowhammer]] clan is preparing a ritual that will return the old God [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Naruun/Naruun\|Naruun]], who is sealed deep underground in the middle of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/The Basin\|The Basin]]. The Cult sees the old God as the true god of death and the ritual will revive every lost soul in [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/The Basin\|The Basin]].

To do that, [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/The Shaddowhammer\|The Shaddowhammer]] are in the process of collecting 3 Artifacts that were used to seal the old god.

- The **Heart of the forrest**, the [[Promises of Victory/General/Storys/Artifact of Life\|Artifact of Life]] which they try to get by Invading city of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/Todo/Sturmklau\|Sturmklau]] 
- The **Tear of the Archdevil**, the [[Promises of Victory/General/Storys/Artifact of Chaos\|Artifact of Chaos]] which the players are bringing into [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/The Basin\|The Basin]] to be delivered to [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/Dr Phalando\|Dr Phalando]] 
- **Sundawn**, the [[Promises of Victory/General/Storys/Artifact of Light\|Artifact of Light]] which they already have since their Leader [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/Volar\|Volar]] is a Fallen Paladin of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/🏰Lichtachte/Lichtachte\|Lichtachte]] 

They need to bring the Artifacts to 3 different ancient arcane machineries called [[Promises of Victory/General/Storys/Titan Forges\|Titan Forges]] and fuel the Jail with a vast amount of soul energy.

To activate the Ritual the call the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/Turnback\|Turnback]] they need a gigantic amount of  [[Promises of Victory/General/Storys/Souls of the Dead\|Souls of the Dead]] that they have been gathering on the Battlefields and funneling into the Central City of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/🏰Edschmied/Edschmied\|Edschmied]] 

The party has to find the artifacts to maybe alter the ritual and kill [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Naruun/Naruun\|Naruun]] for good, while not also falling to the false promisses of the old god. This is a Major Plot twist. The Party starts by searching for the Artifacts and thinks bringing them to the Forges harms the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/The Shaddowhammer\|Shaddowhammer]].

Those are the Plot Threads the Players can optionally solve:

The party can learn about the and Origin of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/The Shaddowhammer\|The Shaddowhammer]] and [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/Volar\|Volar]], their founder.

The [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/LPF/League of Paranormal Researchers\|League of Paranormal Researchers]] secretly killed his daughter to find out more about the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Nosem/Nosem\|Nosem]].
This led to him being seduced by the Fulfiller, a hag that wants to revive [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Naruun/Naruun\|Naruun]].

She promises him [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Naruun/Naruun\|Naruun]] will be able to revive his daughter, but in reality he only leads to the freeing of the old God.

This leads to the endless war going back and fourth. With one party pusshing right to the enemys gate, but then loosing by a sudden turn of events.

The party can learn, that the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Naruun/Stoalium\|Stoalium]] is the reason for this unending loop, that they can use to end the conflict once and for all.

## Naruuns Real Identity
[[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Fulfiller/The Fulfiller\|The Fulfiller]] is the key of resolving the secret of Naruuns real identify, by investigating the Hag and the  [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/Todo/Fulfiller's Market\|Fulfiller's Market]] the players can uncover the true nature of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Naruun/Naruun\|Naruun]] as the old god of false promises. By learning his true identity, they can devise a plan to expose him and his manipulations to the people of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/The Basin\|The Basin]], weakening his power and influence over them.

Through their investigation, the party can discover that [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Naruun/Naruun\|Naruun]] has been feeding on the despair and unfulfilled desires of the people in [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/The Basin\|The Basin]], using their suffering to increase his power. The continuous war, fueled by the properties of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Naruun/Stoalium\|Stoalium]], has provided Naruun with an endless supply of misery.

Armed with this knowledge, the party can seek allies among both the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/League of Arathor/League of Arathor\|League of Arathor]] and the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Defilers/Defilers\|Defilers]], uniting them against a common enemy.
