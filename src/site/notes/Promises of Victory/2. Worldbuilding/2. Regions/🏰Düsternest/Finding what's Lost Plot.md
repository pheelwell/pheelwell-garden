## Finding what's Lost Plot

This is a plot that the players can embark on to learn about the **[[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|lost Hops]]**. If they sympathise with the burglar group, they can use them to plan a heist on the **Church of [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/2. Regions/🏰Lichtachte/Lichtachte\|Lichtachte]]** to steal the **[[Promises of Victory/1. General/Storys/Artifact of Life\|Artifact of Life]]**.

### Precondition

#### [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Unaffiliated/Izen\|Izen]]

When the player made [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Unaffiliated/Izen\|Izen]] leave **[[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/2. Regions/🏰Herbstbog/Herbstbog\|Herbstbog]]** to investigate the Mages he traveled to **[[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/2. Regions/🏰Düsternest/Düsternest\|Düsternest]]** to further research. He is trying to get into contact with the **[[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|Lost Hops]]** to work for them and will ask the players to intentionally get robbed. 
Izen also asks the party to look for [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Unaffiliated/Martin\|Martin]], his personal assistant who he didn't have contact to after Martin left of to search for the Lost Hops on his own. 
## Secrets
His assistant [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Unaffiliated/Martin\|Martin]] actually is the child of a Member of the **[[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|Lost Hops]]**.

### Getting Robbed by the [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|Daughters]]

If the party is not careful, they may get robbed by the [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|Daughters]]. The [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|Daughters]] will try to pickpocket the party, or grab a purse or bag. If they are successful, they will take what they can and flee.
The [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|Daughters]] will bring the stolen goods to their **Safehouse**.

### Going to the Safehouse

If the party goes to the safe house, they can **enter it by picking the lock** (DC 10) or through force.
Once inside, they will find a small group of [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|Daughters]] counting the stolen goods. If the party is discovered, the [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|Daughters]] will try to flee and **alert the rest of [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|The Lost Hops]]**.
If captured, the Daugthers may **lead the players back** to their hideout.
Failing to **convince/intimidate** (DC 15) the [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|Daughters]] will lead them into sending you into a prepared ambush.

#### The Ambush

The ambush is lead by a hooded woman and happens at an abandoned warehouse. If the player fails to spot it (**Perception DC 18**), they get ambushed by an overwhelming force of [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|Lost Hops]].
Once the party is captured, the hooded woman interrogates them to figure out why they were looking for [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|The Lost Hops]] after that she alters the Players memory to forget the interrogation.
Don't Rollplay the interrogation but let the Party roll up to 3 **Wisdom saving throws (DC 18)** to determine what Information gets slipped to [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|The Lost Hops]] beforehand.
For every failed Wisdom (Detect Thoughts deep search) saving throw, the hooded woman knows about one piece of Information that she might find interesting.
Just describe the hooded woman warning them to not and then letting them go. Let the Party all roll a Wisdom saving throw (DC 18) to determining if the modify memory Spell is successful.


![a_beer_brewer_thieves_guild_pickpocket_dungeons_and_.png](/img/user/Pictures/a_beer_brewer_thieves_guild_pickpocket_dungeons_and_.png)
If a Player passes the check, tell that he remembers something and play out a flashback scene.
The Players find themselves back surrounded by the burglars, but this time [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|Mom]] stands infront of them.
On a Perception check, the party can **make out [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Unaffiliated/Martin\|Martin]] in the Croud**. He will not react to the party calling him.
One by one the party gets asked a simple question by a [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|mom]], during that she casts detect thoughts on 3 different Members while interrogating them.
After that, she forces the party to drink a potion of lost memory.
She continues to tell the same warning they thought to remember and the flashbacks ends.

### Finding the real safe house

#### [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|Daughters]] Safehouse

The safe house is actually a small shop in the market district. It is disguised as a flower shop, and the [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|Daughters]] use it to sell their stolen goods. The shop is run by Daisy, one of the [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|Daughters]]. If the party goes to the shop, they can talk to Daisy and purchase some of the stolen goods. They may also be able to convince her (DC15) to take them back to [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|Helena]]'s laboratory.

#### Main Hideout

The [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|sons]] have a hidden lair beneath an abandoned building in Oldtown. To get there, they must go through a secret entrance in an alleyway that leads down into sewers under [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/2. Regions/🏰Düsternest/Düsternest\|Düsternest]].(You might want your players find this place before you tell them about it.) Inside the sewer System there are several tunnels leading off from the main Tunnel. One of these side tunnels will lead to their hideout if followed long enough.
The Main Hideout is a large cavern that has been converted into a comfortable living space. There are several beds, a kitchen area, and a brewing area where [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|The Lost Hops]] make their beer. The hideout also contains [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|Helena]]'s laboratory, where she works on her potion making and other magical research.

##### Laboratory

Inside [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|Helena]]'s laboratory, the party can find all sorts of strange chemicals and potions. They may also find evidence (DC20) of Moms [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/Ritual of Name\|Ritual of Name]] being performed here. If they search long enough (1 hour), they may also find an unfinished potion that will allow them to remember their interrogation if they drink it.



#### Entering the Hideout

If the party goes to the hideout, they can enter it through the front door. Once inside, they may hear a group of [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|sons]] arguing. The Party can try to talk to evesdrops (DC10) on the conversation to learn that they are discussing a heist on the [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/2. Regions/🏰Lichtachte/Lichtachte\|Lichtachte]] catherdal.
The [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|Sons]] will stop their conversation if they are approached. If the party tries to fight the [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|sons]], they will be outnumbered and outmatched.
If the party persuades/decepts (DC15) the [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|sons]], they will explain that they plan an secret competition testing for new recruits. The target is the [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/2. Regions/🏰Lichtachte/Lichtachte\|Lichtachte]] Cathedral. (Read [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/2. Regions/🏰Düsternest/The Cathedral Competition Plothook\|The Cathedral Competition Plothook]] for more Infos)
If the Party are suspicious the can roll an insight check (DC 18) to spot that something is foul.


#### Finding [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Unaffiliated/Martin\|Martin]]

The party can spot [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Unaffiliated/Martin\|Martin]] in the Main hideout sitting next to an older Man, scowering through some loot. If they approach him, he doesn't remember the group ([[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Unaffiliated/Martin\|Martin]] is affected by the [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/Ritual of Name\|Ritual of Name]]).
If the party calls him by his name, he will correct them and tell them he is called "Derik".
If the party tries to remind him of his past, he will forget about it in one minute, but will remember that the party tried to make him remember something about his past.
He will kindly ask the party not to, and tell them that it has no use. He now has another life here with [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|The Lost Hops]].
If the party uses charm or persuasion (DC15) on him or an insight check (DC18), they can realize that he is being controlled by magic.
[[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Unaffiliated/Martin\|Martin]] is aware of him forgetting it by magical means, and tells the party that this was his choice by joining the [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|Sons]].

#### Escaping with [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Unaffiliated/Martin\|Martin]]

If the party tries to take [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Unaffiliated/Martin\|Martin]] with them by force, he will warn the [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|Sons]]. If they try to sneak him out, they will need to be very stealthy. If they are successful, they can take him back to Moms laboratory.

#### Moms Laboratory

Moms laboratory is located in the hideout. It is a small room that is filled with potions and other magical items. [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|Mom]] is working on a potion when the party enters. If they talk to her, she will be surprised to see them, and she will ask them what they are doing there.
If the party takes [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Unaffiliated/Martin\|Martin]] back to [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|Helena]]'s laboratory, she explains that the magic is permanent and his amnesia will last forever. All she can offer is a temporary potion that will allow him to remember his past for a short time.



#### A Moment of Clarity

If the party can convince [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Unaffiliated/Martin\|Martin]] to take the potion (DC15), he will remember his past for a short time. He will remember his family, his life before [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|The Lost Hops]], and he will remember his friends. He will also remember that he joined [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|The Lost Hops]] because he found his lost Father, the man he was siting with. He will burst into tears and tell the party that he regrets his choice. The Ritual can't be reverted, so he saw this as his only option to reunite with his family. But not even remembering his choice breaks his heart.
[[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|Helena]] will join in and tell the Party that the Party that [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|The Lost Hops]] have Noble Goals, and do no harm. In the End it was Martins Choice to join [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|The Lost Hops]] the ritual only works that way.
The Potion will fade and [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Unaffiliated/Martin\|Martin]] will forget again, but he will remember the party. Allthough not remembering his past, he will be grateful to them for reminding him , and he will offer to help them in any way he can.
[[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|Helena]] will proceed to erase the memory of the conversation from herself and [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Unaffiliated/Martin\|Martin]]. She will ask the party for permission to also erase their memory but will also respect their decision.

#### Reverting the Ritual

Although the chances are slim, [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|Helena]] wants the party to find a way to revert the Ritual. She will hand out a Notebook that details her work. The party will need to pass a difficult arcana check (DC 24) to realize that the Ritual sends the Memories into the afterlife, and the Players would need to gather the lost Memories there.
