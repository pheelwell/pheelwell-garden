Hort was a village of little renown, its population scarce and mostly composed of the diminutive halflings and gnomes. With no trade or nearby mines to provide coin, the villagers lived in poverty. They were a surly lot, harsh of tongue and unhelpful in attitude. 

The village had been blessed with a small shrine to their patron god of agriculture, but it had long since been abandoned and left to decay. The folk of Hort instead turned their devotion mostly to the god of luck, praying that they receive all the aid they could possibly muster.
Hort was a place best avoided by travelers; it was poor and dangerous, an ill fate for any adventurer.

# The Goats involvement
Ontop of the poverty [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Goats/The Goats\|The Goats]] have an heavy influence on the Towns people  Baphomet, the Leader of the [[Goats\|Goats]] has a reputation of fear among the locals, tales of his deeds being whispered in hushed tones and from within the shadows.
* Tales tell that Baphomet was an outcast from a nearby elven city who found solace amongst the goats and brought with him knowledge of dark and forbidden magic. 
* As he rose to power among the goats he slowly turned them towards darker actions and rituals, transforming them into a cult of were-goats that haunt the night seeking out sacrifices to their dark god.
* The villagers have been known to disappear in strange circumstances, leaving families broken hearted and fearing for their lives should they cross paths with [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Goats/The Goats\|The Goats]].
# The Shrine
In spite of all this darkness, one beacon still shines in Hort’s murky night: A small shrine dedicated to the god of agriculture. 
* Though it is old and in disrepair, villagers still come here to give tribute and prayer for luck in their efforts. 
* The shrine is also seen as a symbol of resilience by some locals; even if Hort is down on its luck, at least they can still honor their gods. 
* A few poor souls also come here seeking guidance from whatever deity watches over them, hoping for some kind of answer that will pull them out of this cycle of despair.

The people of Hort had all but forgotten the small shrine to the god of agriculture in their village, a relic of better times when they were not so desperate and destitute. When Baphomet and his cult of were-goats began terrorizing them in the night, however, they remembered that long forgotten shrine and began to offer prayers there once more.

It was then that [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Goats/The Goats\|The Goats]] made their first appearance in Hort. They presented themselves as a mercenary organization sent to rid the town of its goat-man pests, and for a price, they offered their services. The villagers had no other choice but to accept, and soon [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Goats/The Goats\|The Goats]] were busily tracking down the were-goats plaguing them.
 The people of Hort have a close relationship with the old god, Nar’uun. Their worship of the god of luck is due in part to their reverence for Nar’uun, for he is known as the God of Fate and Fortune. The people of Hort view him as a protector who will bring them good luck and help them in times of need. They often make offerings to him in the hopes that he will bring them blessings and good fortune.
