The cult of the Gifted is receiving Gifts of the god [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Naruun/Naruun\|Naruun]], who they believe is the true god of death. What they don't know is that [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Naruun/Naruun\|Naruun]] is the sealed away evil god of false promises.
The cult is mostly made up of people that have lost somebody. The cult has been gaining in power as more and more people join. 
The Cult poses as an empathetic, non Violent Party. Their current goal is to construct an Apperatus Underneath [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/2. Regions/🏰Edschmied/Edschmied\|Edschmied]], that Channels the Energy of [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Naruun/Naruun\|Naruun]], reviving everyone in [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/2. Regions/The Basin\|The Basin]], reverting every undead back to being Human. They call the Ritual "the [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Shaddowhammer/Turnback\|Turnback]]".

Note:
The Acolytes of the gifted flock around [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Naruun/Naruun\|Naruun]] like Moths flying towards the light. I want to Theme the Cult around Moths.

# Real Appearance
One Player plays a Priest that learned the Rituals of the Gifted ones through books, so his Application of the Magic looks exactly like [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Naruun/Naruun\|Naruun]] true nature. Devouring tentacles that consume everything.

# Plot Hooks

## Suspicion

The cult is using the ongoing war in the region to their advantage, posing as traveling priests, offering healing to the soldiers. Little do the soldiers know, that the cult is sacrificing them to their god. One of the soldiers, Jorr, starts to suspect the cult when he sees them healing people who have already died. He begins to investigate and discovers the motives of the cult. Jorr rallies the other soldiers and leads an attack on the cult, killing [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Shaddowhammer/Volar\|Volar]] and freeing the people they had captured.

## Doubt

One of the cultists, Dorn, starts to have doubts about what they're doing. He begins to investigate and discovers the truth about the cult and their evil god. Dorn tries to warn the other cultists, but they don't believe him and try to kill him. Dorn manages to escape and goes to the party for help. Together they go back to stop the cult and free the people they had captured.
