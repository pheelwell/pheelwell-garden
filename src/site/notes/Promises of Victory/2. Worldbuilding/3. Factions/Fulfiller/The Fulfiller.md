The Fulfiller is an old Hag who lived since before the imprisonment of [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Cult of the Gifted/The Cult of the Gifted\|Naruun]]. She lives from feeding bad emotions, similar to [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Cult of the Gifted/The Cult of the Gifted\|Naruun]]. Since [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Cult of the Gifted/The Cult of the Gifted\|Naruun]] the very existance and acting of [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Cult of the Gifted/The Cult of the Gifted\|Naruun]] provided the Fulfiller with many dreams beeing shattered, she sympathises with the old god and wants to free him again, so that he can start feeding off of the bad emotions of people again.

While [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Cult of the Gifted/The Cult of the Gifted\|Naruun]] is imporisoned she established her own way of giving false promisses. she built a traveling market on which she provides unsuspecting people with ways to fulfill their desires.

She starts by analysing the past through her crystal ball and finds a desire to latch on. If possible she tries to strike a deal with the person which seems to fullfill their desires, but make them fall into deep despair at their peak of joy.

In the Fulfillers takes the more joy the more the people fall into despair. The intenser the change fate the more the Fulfiller takes pride in it. For example, a curse that will slowly deteriorate someone, is not very fulfilling, but a curse that will shatter the deepest dreams just before archiving them is the best.
The Fulfiller collects the accumilations of those bad emotions in little trinkes she collects from the victims beforehand. If she can arange it, she also likes to be there when the tragedy hapens.

As an Example, a young man who always wanted to be a great warrior, but was too weak. The Fulfiller would offer him a magical sword which makes him very strong. Then she would convince him into joining a troupe that slaughters a bandit camp but instead leads him into a massacre of an innocent village. The young man would be filled with remorse and hate, and the Fulfiller would feed off of that.

> ### Actions
>
> **_ multiattack._** The Fulfiller makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.
>
> **_Bite._** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw against disease or become diseased. The disease has no effect for 1 minute and can be removed by any magic that cures disease. After 1 minute, the diseased creature's hit point maximum decreases by 5 (1d10) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the creature's hit point maximum drops to 0 as a result of this disease, the creature dies.
>
> **_Claw._** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 10 (2d4 + 5) slashing damage.
>
> **_Draining Touch._** _Melee Spell Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ The target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (4d6) necrotic damage and have its hit point maximum reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. The creature is healed by the same amount if the necrotic damage dealt to it would reduce its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the creature's hit point maximum lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. The creature dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
>
> **_Soul Leech._** The Fulfiller targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or take 14 (4d6) necrotic damage, and the Fulfiller regains hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt. If the target's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the Fulfiller's Soul Leech for the next 24 hours.
>
> **_Despair Aura._** The Fulfiller emits a magical aura that extends outward from itself in a 100-foot radius. Whenever a creature that can see the Fulfiller's aura starts its turn in that aura, it must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw, unless the Fulfiller is incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature is filled with despair for 1 minute. While under this effect, the creature has disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws, other than Wisdom saving throws, and the creature can't take reactions. In addition, its speed is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC, and it can't attack or cast spells. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
