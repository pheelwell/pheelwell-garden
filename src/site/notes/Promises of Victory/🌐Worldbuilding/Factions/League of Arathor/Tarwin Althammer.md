Tarwin Althammer was a respected and honorable human Paladin, renowned for his stalwart dedication to justice and upholding the law. His skill in combat was matched only by his strong sense of morality, and he was known for his unwavering loyalty to the righteous cause.

Tarwin hailed from the city of [[🌐Skoria/🌐Worldbuilding/Material Plane/🏞️The Basin/Regions/Gandmuel/Gandmuehl\|Gandmuehl]], where he lived with his beloved wife Marit, an elven musician, and their daughter Reyala - a prodigy whose life was cut too short by a tragic and mysterious murder.

His travels eventually brought him to [[Promises of Victory/🗡️Adventuring/Player Characters/Ransden\|Ransden]], where he used the knowledge gained from his experiences to create documents that would help others find justice in similar situations.
