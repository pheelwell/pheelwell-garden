In reality it will break [[Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/Naruun\|Naruun]]s Prison and set him free.

The Turnback was first given to [[Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/Volar\|Volar]] by [[Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/The Fulfiller\|The Fulfiller]].
