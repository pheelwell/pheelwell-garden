His quest led him to writings from The Basin that mention a dark ritual that may help him regain his humanity. The writings include partially decipherable runes and words connected to resurrection, devotion, and sacrifice.One of the documents was written by Tarwin Althammer, who seemed hopeful about seeing his loved ones again with the help of this ritual. Tarwin mentioned finding a suitable location for the ritual within The Basin. Ransden's journey took him to Hammerfall in The Basin in search of more information about this potential solution. Along the way, he discovered additional documents containing more decipherable words related to gathering and secrets. Ransden learned about Naru'un, an unknown god associated with rebirth who might be connected to his quest for humanity. Legends claim that Naru'un's tentacles once covered The Basin.

Unfortunately, an old rival framed him for his father's death, causing him to leave the group and become distrusted by his tribe. During his time in The Basin, Jamoke learned that his sister, Jaloren, had gone missing. The loa of death revealed to him that she was involved with the Shaddowhammer cult's rituals. Believing she is being mind-controlled by the cult, Jamoke has been searching for her ever since.Jamoke is now traveling with a party in hopes of finding Jaloren and stopping the Shaddowhammer cult. As a Shadow Hunter subclass character, he has some secrets related to his sister and her involvement with the cult. Unbeknownst to him, Jaloren willingly joined the cult after being brainwashed by their promises and even killed their father as he was about to expose them. Jamoke's goal is to save Jaloren from the Shaddowhammer cult by convincing her that they are using her for their own nefarious purposes. Clues to her whereabouts include a gemstone left by Jaloren that can be used for tracking her down, reconnecting with the Loas for guidance on her location, and seeking information from Horde Camps as suggested by Jamoke's rival.In order to save Jaloren, Jamoke must locate her using the gemstone she left behind and persuade her that she has been manipulated by the Shaddowhammer cult into believing they will help resurrect their father.</li></ul> |
