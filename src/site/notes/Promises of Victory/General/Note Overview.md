He died during an attack on Lichtachte and was reanimated as an undead soldier by a necromancer, becoming a victim of the Plage. Over time, Ransden regained his memories from his previous life, including his wife Helene Arcfall and their two children, Raiden and Ralyen. As the necromancer's power weakened, Ransden rebelled and escaped to Undercity.In Undercity, Ransden became a librarian and started researching ways to become human again. His quest led him to writings from The Basin that mention a dark ritual that may help him regain his humanity. The writings include partially decipherable runes and words connected to resurrection, devotion, and sacrifice.One of the documents was written by Tarwin Althammer, who seemed hopeful about seeing his loved ones again with the help of this ritual. Tarwin mentioned finding a suitable location for the ritual within The Basin. Ransden's journey took him to Hammerfall in The Basin in search of more information about this potential solution. Along the way, he discovered additional documents containing more decipherable words related to gathering and secrets. Ransden learned about Naru'un, an unknown god associated with rebirth who might be connected to his quest for humanity. Legends claim that Naru'un's tentacles once covered The Basin. Ransden continues to research Naru'un and hopes to find a way to reclaim his humanity through this mysterious deity's powers.</li></ul> |
