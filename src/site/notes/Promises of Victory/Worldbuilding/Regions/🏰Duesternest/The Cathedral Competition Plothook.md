## The Cathedral Competition Plothook

The Cathedral Competition is a heist that the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|Sons]] are planning. They will be testing for new recruits by having them steal an artifact from the Cathedral of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/🏰Lichtachte/Lichtachte\|Lichtachte]]. The goal is to steal as much as possible.
The competition will take place at night, and the party will have to be stealthy. They will need to avoid the guards, and they will need to find a way to open the safe.
The competition takes place in 2 weeks. This kicks of the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/🏰Lichtachte/Heist on the Cathedral Plot\|Heist on the Cathedral Plot]]

### Aquiring the Cathedral Plans

To aquire the Cathedral Plans, the party will need to break into the Architecture Studio of **Langley and [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|Sons]]**. The firm is located in the market district.
Once inside, the party will need to find the office of **John Langley**. His office is on the second floor. Inside his office, they will find the plans for the cathedral.

Asking around the players can gather that the Studio is famous for their mechanical work on high security etablisments.

#### From the Outside

The Architecture Studio of Langley and [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|Sons]] is located in the market district of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/🏰Duesternest/Duesternest\|Duesternest]]. It is situated in an alley between two other buildings. There are no windows on the first floor. The second floor has two windows, one on each side of the building. The roof has a skylight. The exterior of the house is made of stone and looks very sturdy. The door is made of wood and has a brass knocker. There is a small sign above the door that reads "Langley and [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|Sons]]".
The roof of the house is made of slate and is very steep. There is a skylight in the center of the roof.

#### Entering at Daytime

If the party tries to enter the building during the day, there will be buissness going on. They can try to sneak in without being seen, but if they are seen they will be confronted by the receptionist.
On searching for traps the party can find some of the many Traps in the Studio Area:
|DC|Location|Trap|
|-|-|-|
| 10| Reception| **Shocking Grasp** trap on the door handle|
| 13| Stairways Ground Level| **Dart Trap** on one of the stair steps|
| 20|Studio Area| **Lightning Bolt** trap in the center of the room|
| 21| Second Floor| **Fireball** trap in the middle of the hallway|
| 21| Hallway | **Slide into Acid Pool** trap at the bottom of the stairs|
| 23| John Langleys Office| **Poison Dart** trap in the desk drawer|
|25| John Langleys Office| **Animated Armor** inside the closet|
| 26| Basement| **Pit Trap** in the middle of the room|
| 27| Basement| **Poison Dart** trap in the corner of the room|

If the party convinces the receptionist to let them in they can explore the Studio Area and the Stairways Ground Level without any trouble.
On the other side, if the party decides to forcefully enter the building they will have to deal with the traps.

Additionally to the traps, in the Studio Areas, replicas of the traps are layed out to show potential customers.


#### Entering at Nighttime

If the party tries to enter the building at night, they will find that the door is locked. They will need to pick the lock (DC 16) or break the door down to get inside.
Once inside, they will find that the building is dark and empty. They can light a torch, but this will make it easier for the guards to spot them.
