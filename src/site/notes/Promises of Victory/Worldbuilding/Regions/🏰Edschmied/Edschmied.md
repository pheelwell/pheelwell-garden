### Geography

Edschmied lays in the center of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/The Basin\|The Basin]] and is a giant castle mostly populated by dwarfs. The city is most well known for the craftmanship and the processing of the metal [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Things/Stoalium\|Stoalium]]. 

### Politics

Since Edschmeid is producing many weapons and armor for the war, the faction currently controlling the city is providing the manufacturing dwarfs guild named “The Cold Heaven” with materials in return for the high quality weapons, which are then resold to the armies of the factions at a markup.

The Cold Heaven stand neutral to both factions, they are more interested in craft then Politics. While at times the city is under Siege, the iron dwarf guilds are granted imunity since they are the valuable asset of the city. Controlling Edschmied means having a weapon supply for the war efforts, because of that Edschmied is a important Landmark for the war efforts of both factions.
