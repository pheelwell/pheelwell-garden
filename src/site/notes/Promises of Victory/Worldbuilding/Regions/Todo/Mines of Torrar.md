The guild leader, who owns the mines, also owns all the crude ore. He is an enthusiastic man, and has invested his money well, but has no one around him with the experience to manage the money well. Treasurers come and go from the guild, and several have mysteriously disappeared. This is caused in part by the dank, humid conditions and the miners horrible sanitary conditions
The Mines of Torrar are also home to a large number of creatures, including trolls, ogres, and spiders. These creatures are kept in check by the miners, and are not a major threat to them.
