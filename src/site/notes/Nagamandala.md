### Summary

layer 1 - playwright 
layer 2 - giggling flames
layer 3 - flame who arrives late
layer 4 - Rani 

On the **first narrative level**, the frame story is about the playwright who has to stay awake for the whole night in the temple, to let the curse pass. The night of that theatrical performance was his last chance to see that the audience stay awake the entire night while watching his play. We hear author-narrator‟s repeated laments,  
“I may be dead within the next few hours.”  

**Mythical elements** can be seen in the second and the third narrative level. 

The author-narrator meeting the giggling flames (who each one carry their own story) becomes the second story. These personified flames go to the same ruined  
temple where the author is.  

On the third level, we find a tale by a flame, who wants to be forgiven for arriving late to the hosting place. The tale is about an old woman who knew an interesting story but refused to share it with others.  The story slipped out of the old woman's mouth as she snored and it transformed into a beautiful young lady and the song that accompanies it turns into a beautiful sari.

The fourth narrative level is the story of Rani, the lady who born out of the story from the old hag's mouth. Rani becomes the main character of the play Nagamandala.
