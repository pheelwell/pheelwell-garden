## Intro 
**William Schultz** 
1950s 
54 item questionnaire

B = Behaviour 

three dimensions - inclusion, control, affection 
	**Inclusion** assesses the degree to which a person associates with others.  (belonging, recognition, participation)
	**Control** measures the extent to which a person assumes responsibility, makes decisions or  dominates people.  (leadership, responsibility, influence, decision making)
	**Affection** reflects the degree to which a person becomes emotionally involved with others(sensitivity, openness, warmth, closeness, relating to others)

two aspects - wanted and expressed
	**wanted** - How much does an individual prefer others to take the initiative? How much does an individual want to be on the receiving end of those behaviours?
	**expressed** - How much does an individual prefer to initiate the behaviour?
	


assumes that these three areas are fundamental in understanding and predicting  
interpersonal behaviour.

### Theoretical Expectation

The first public usage of the test was in the late 1950s by William Shutz. The basic  
premise for his theory was “people need people”, and people interpersonal needs motivate their behaviors.
