# What is Cloud Computing? 
- it is the **on-demand** delivery of IT resources over the Internet with **pay-as-you-go pricing**

- on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user

# Why?
tldr; do not need to buy, own, and maintain resources; scalable; pay only what you use; global

Look below for elaboration on why

# Characteristics 

on-demand 
	can use whenever needed
	once configured, it can be automated (?) 

ubiquitous access  
	widely accessible 
	this is done using different protocols, devices, interfaces, security technologies 
	tailored to particular needs 	

[[Multitenancy in Cloud Computing]] 

elasticity, scalability 

resilience

measured usage

# Advantages
Cost Effective 
	Computing as a **Utility** - Pay for what you use
	Cost sharing of data centers
	minimal to no maintenance required
	Energy consumption saved 
	no need to hire experts 
	servicing and upgrading not required 

**Elasticity** - easily scale up or down dynamically

Remote Access, Collaboration
	can share info 
	access files real time 
	across the globe 

Multiple services offered in a single location 
Speed of operations
Sever Provisioning
Server Cloning
Built-in services for disaster recovery and failover
Data center security and certifications

# Disadvantages
- we do not have physical control of data 
- limited control over physical resources 
- possibility of unwarranted shutdown
- have to rely on third party security
