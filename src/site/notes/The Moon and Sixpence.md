### Extra 

**Paul Gauguin**

>"Teha'amana was much younger than [Gauguin] and their ability to enjoy anything like a marriage was extremely limited," said Ms Thomson. "They couldn't even speak the same language. It was not an equal relationship, and it wasn't a clear cut professional relationship ... He justified his children by saying that Tahiti always welcomed [the birth of] children. They were something to be celebrated.
> - Belinda Thomson, chief curator of Gauguin's work at Tate Modern in London

Noa Noa, his semi-fictional travel memoirs and traditional island stories which he claimed to have gleaned from Teha'amana's ancient tribal lore, turned out to be copied from a textbook of Polynesian life.
Inspired Picasso to exploit women
