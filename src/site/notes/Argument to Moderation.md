**logical fallacy** that assumes that the truth is always a compromise between two opposite positions. It is also known as false compromise, argument from middle ground, or the golden mean fallacy. 

An example of this fallacy would be to claim that the sky is green because one person says it is blue and another says it is yellow. This fallacy ignores the possibility that one of the positions may be correct or more reasonable than the other, or that there may be other alternatives besides the two extremes
